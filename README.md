# surfs_up
Practicing SQLlite, Flask 

## Overview of the statistical analysis:
  We are using SQLalchemy to extract weather information from a flat file.  We filter the data and organize it into a dataframe to be able to make decisions 
  on a potential business opportunity.
  ### Purpose of Analysis
  The purpose is to use weather data to determine the feasible of opening a surf/ice cream shop in Hawaii.   

## Results
  - The average temperatures for June (74.94) and Dec (71.04) are off by only 3 degrees.  This indicates similar weather conditions year round.
  - The Minimum temperature recorded in Dec(56) is noticeably less than the minimum in June(64).  This is understandable and relays that despite similar temperatures there are still days in December that aren't condusive to great surf and ice cream days. 
  - The standard deviation for both months (Dec-3.74, June-3.25) describe little fluctuations in temperature during these months.  That stability is a positve.

## Summary

  There are definitely differences in the weather conditions for both months, which can be inferenced to determine what year round conditions can be expected.
  The differences however aren't significant enough to expect wild swings in conditions and can be seen as an indicator of stable year round warm weather.
  Even when looking at rain data for both months, though it is clear that December has more inches of rain on average, it is not significant enough to believe
  this would discourage the prospect of many days of surfing and ice cream.
